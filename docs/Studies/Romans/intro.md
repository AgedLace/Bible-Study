### The Book of Romans - Introduction
___

The central theme of the Book of Romans can be summed up in one word - righteousness.

Job asks a very important question ...

> **Job 9:2 BSB**  
>  
> 2 Yes, I know that it is so, but **how can a mortal [man] be righteous before God?**  
>  

The Book of Romans is God's answer to this question.

What did Jesus have to say about righteousness?

>  
> 6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.

> **Matthew 5:10 BSB**  
> 
> 10 Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

> **Matthew 5:20 BSB**  
> 
> 20 For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.

> **Matthew 6:1 BSB**  
> 
> 1 Be careful not to perform your righteous acts before men to be seen by them.  If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.

> [!NOTE|style:callout]

> **Matthew 6:33 BSB**  
> 
> 33 But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added unto you.

From these Scriptures it is clear that if we want to be true disciples of Jesus, then righteousness must be a priority for us.

The rest of this study will focus on what exactly is righteousness and how can we attain it.
