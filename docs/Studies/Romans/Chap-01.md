>  
> 10 in my prayers at all times, asking that now at last **_by God's will_** I may succeed in coming to you.  
>  
> 11 For **_I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you_,**  
>  
> 12 and, that is, **_that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith._**  
>  
> 13 I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, how often I **_planned to come to you_** (but have been prevented from visiting until now), **_in order that I might have a harvest among you_**, just as I have had among the other Gentiles.  
>  
> 14 I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish.  
>  
> 15 Thus as to me there is readiness to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome.  
>  
> 16 I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, then to the Greek.  
>  17 For the gospel reveals the righteousness of God that comes by faith from start to finish, just as it is written: "The righteous will live by faith."
