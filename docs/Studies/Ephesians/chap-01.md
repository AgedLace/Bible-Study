Apostles are ...

The faithful followers of Christ Jesus are called "holy people" or "saints" because they are devoted and consecrated wholly to God and have chosen to be separated from sin and the world.  

This reminds me of God's commandment to "be ye holy because I am holy!"  1 Peter 1:14-16.

Paul gives praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.  Why?  

Father God has ...

* blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms  

Why?

* because we are united with Christ

Question - 

* What is the significance / importance of "in the heavenly realms"?

Are there no spiritual blessings in the earthly realm because satan rules here?

God is spirit; those who worship Him must worship in spirit and in truth.  John 4:24
