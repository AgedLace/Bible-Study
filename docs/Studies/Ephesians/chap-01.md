Apostles are ...  

* chosen by the will of God
* [apostles / messengers of] Christ Jesus
* a special messenger sent out with orders

> [!TIP|style:callout]

> **will [of God] - G2307 - thelema**

It was God's purpose and desire to choose Paul to be His special messenger to the holy and faithful followers of Christ Jesus in Ephesus.

> **holy [people] - G40 - hagios**

> holy; saints

>
> sacred, (most) holy (one, thing), saint
>
> - signifies something or someone as "separated" out; refers to people or things which have been set apart from sin and consecrated, dedicated, and devoted wholly to God
>

The faithful followers of Christ Jesus are called "holy people" or "saints" because they are devoted and consecrated wholly to God and have chosen to be separated from sin and the world.  

This reminds me of God's commandment to "be ye holy because I am holy!"  1 Peter 1:14-16.

Paul gives praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.  Why?  

Father God has ...

* blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms  

Why?

* because we are "in" or "united with" Christ

> What is the significance / importance of "in the heavenly realms"?  
> 
> Are there no spiritual blessings in the earthly realm because satan rules here?
>  
> God is spirit; those who worship Him must worship in spirit and in truth.  John 4:24  
>
> heavenly realms because our citizenship is now in heaven?  Eph 2:6  
>

> [!TIP|style:callout]

> **heavenly realms - G2032 - epouranios**  
>
> of or pertaining to God in the highest
>
> pertaining to God's kingdom, sphere, domain
> 

So, Paul is praising God the Father because He has blessed us with ***every*** spiritual blessing that is in His kingdom, sphere, and domain where our citizenship now is.  (See adoption, below).  He has denied us nothing in His kingdom!  And He has done this because we are united with (or "in") Christ Jesus.

> What exactly are these spritual blessings which God has blessed us with?

We will be able to answer this question as we proceed with our study.

> **Eph 1:4 NLT**

> Even before he made the world, God loved us and chose us in Christ to be holy and without fault in his eyes.

Before God created the world ...

- God loved us  
- and chose us [in Christ]  
    - to be holy
    - and without fault [in HIS eyes]

> [!TIP|style:callout]
