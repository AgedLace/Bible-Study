### Verse 1

> **Eph 1:1 NLT**  
>
> This letter is from Paul, chosen by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus. I am writing to God's holy people in Ephesus, who are faithful followers of Christ Jesus.
>

> [!TIP|iconVisibility:hidden]  
>
> **apostle - G652 - apostolos** 
>
> a messenger; a delegate  
> he that is sent; one sent forth with orders
>

Apostles are ...  

* chosen by the will of God
* [apostles / messengers of] Christ Jesus
* a special messenger sent out with orders

> [!TIP|iconVisibility:hidden]  
> 
> **will [of God] - G2307 - thelema**  
>
> desire; pleasure  
>
> [the divine] will  
> - the purpose and choice [of God]
>

It was God's purpose and desire to choose Paul to be His special messenger to the holy and faithful followers of Christ Jesus in Ephesus.  

> [!TIP|iconVisibility:hidden]  
> 
> **holy [people] - G40 - hagios**  
>
> holy; saints  
> 
> set apart [for God] and [away from sin]
>
> sacred, (most) holy (one, thing), saint
>
> - signifies something or someone as "separated" out; refers to people or things which have been set apart from sin and consecrated, dedicated, and devoted wholly to God
>

The faithful followers of Christ Jesus are called "holy people" or "saints" because they are devoted and consecrated wholly to God and have chosen to be separated from sin and the world.  

This reminds me of God's commandment to "be ye holy because I am holy!"  1 Peter 1:14-16.

### Verse 3  

> [!NOTE|iconVisibility:hidden]  
>
> **Eph 1:3 NLT**  
> 
> All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms because we are united with Christ.  

> [!TIP|iconVisibility:hidden]

> - pronouce a consecratory blessing on  
> 
> of God  
> - to cause to prosper, to make happy, to bestow blessing on  
> - favored of God, blessed
>

Paul gives praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.  Why?  

Father God has ...

* blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms  

Why?

* because we are "in" or "united with" Christ

> [!WARNING|iconVisibility:hidden]  
>
> What is the significance / importance of "in the heavenly realms"?  
> 
> Are there no spiritual blessings in the earthly realm because satan rules here?
>  
> God is spirit; those who worship Him must worship in spirit and in truth.  John 4:24  
>
> heavenly realms because our citizenship is now in heaven?  Eph 2:6  
>

> [!TIP|iconVisibility:hidden]  
>
> **heavenly realms - G2032 - epouranios**  
>
> of or pertaining to God in the highest
>
> pertaining to God's kingdom, sphere, domain
> 

So, Paul is praising God the Father because He has blessed us with ***every*** spiritual blessing that is in His kingdom, sphere, and domain where our citizenship now is.  (See adoption, below).  He has denied us nothing in His kingdom!  And He has done this because we are united with (or "in") Christ Jesus.

> What exactly are these spritual blessings which God has blessed us with?  
> 

We will be able to answer this question as we proceed with our study.

### Verse 4  

> [!NOTE|iconVisibility:hidden]  
> 
> **Eph 1:4 NLT**  
> 
> Even before he made the world, God loved us and chose us in Christ to be holy and without fault in his eyes.  
> 

> [!TIP|iconVisibility:hidden]  
> 
> chose - G1586 - eklegomai  
>
> to pick out, select  
> to choose for oneself  
>

- God picked us out
    - for Himself
    - as His own possession

Why?

> [!TIP|iconVisibility:hidden]  
> 
> holy - G40 - hagios  
> 
> most holy thing, a saint  
> sacred, pure, morally blameless, consecrated (set apart)
> 

- That we might be holy, pure and blameless  
- that we might be set apart / consecrated / dedicated to Him  

And ...

> [!TIP|iconVisibility:hidden]  
> 
> blameless - G299 - amomos  
>
> without blame
> without spot, faultless
> without blemish
> 

- That we might be found blameless, without spot or blemish

So, before God had even created the world ...

- He loved us  
- and chose us [in Christ]  
    - to be holy in HIS sight
    - and without fault in HIS eyes

> [!WARNING|iconVisibility:hidden]  
>
> Why the emphasis on "in God's sight / eyes?"  
> 

- In the eyes of the world, good works makes one holy, pure and blameless.
- God's Word says ...

    > [!NOTE|iconVisibility:hidden]  
    > 
    > **Romans 6:23 NLT**  
    >
    > 23 For the wages of sin is death, but **the free gift of God** is eternal life through CHrist Jesus our Lord.  
    > 

    > [!NOTE|iconVisibility:hidden]  
    > 
    > **Romans 3:28 NLT**  
    > 
    > 28 So we are made right with God through faith and not by obeying the law.  
    > 

    > [!NOTE|iconVisibility:hidden]
    > 
    > **Romans 4:5 NLT**  
    > 
    > 5 But people are counted righteous, not because of their work, but because of their faith in God who forgives sinners.  
    > 

> [!WARNING|iconVisibility:hidden]  
>
> So then why is there such an emphasis on doing good works, if they are not the basis for being holy and blameless before God?  
> 

> [!NOTE|iconVisibility:hidden]  
> 
> **Romans 6:16 NLT**  
> 
> 16 Don't you realize that you become the slave of whatever you choose to obey?  You can be a slave to sin, which leads to death, or you can choose to obey God, which leads to righteous living.  
> 

> [!NOTE|iconVisibility:hidden]  
> 
> **James 2:14, 17-18 NLT**  
> 
> 14 What good is it, dear brothers and sisters, if you say you have faith but don't show it by your actions?  Can that kind of faith save anyone?  
> 
> ... 
> 
> 17 So you see, faith by itself isn't enough.  Unless it produces good deeds, it is dead and useless.
> 
> 18 Now someone may argue, "Some people have faith; others have good deeds."  But I say, "How can you show me your faith if you don't have good deeds? I will show you my faith by my good deeds."  
> 

So in summary, our being chosen, loved, and made holy and blameless in God's sight is ...
- A gift of God 
- Cannot be earned by doing good works; can only be received by faith in Christ Jesus
- Faith produces good works as we walk in obedience to God and His commandments
