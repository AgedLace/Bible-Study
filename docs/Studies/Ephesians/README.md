## Ephesians  
___

### Prayer  

Holy Spirit,

lead me and teach me what You want me to know about Your Word today.  Plant it deeply n my heart and spirit; cause it to be well watered and nurtured so it will take deep root and bear much fruit for Your glory, honor and praise!  Open my understandng and insight; reveal any pre-conceived ideas I may have about Your Word that are not correct; please reveal the treasures of the Father's knowledge; produce what You will in and through me, in Jesus' Name.  I plead the Blood of Jesus over my study with You as my Teacher, that nothing can rob me of anything You want to impart.  

Thank you, Holy God!  In Jesus' Name.  Amen.
