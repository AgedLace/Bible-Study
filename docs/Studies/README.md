## Spirit-led Bible Studies
___

This section contains example Spirit-led Bible Studies.  

Don't be surprised if the Holy Spirit does any of the following ...

- He shows you things He not have shown others yet  
- He emphasises different things to you at different times
    - a verse you have read many times may suddenly "jump out" at you
    - it will seem as if you have never 'seen' the passage before
        - this is often due to where you are in your journey with Him 
        - or may be a result of what is going on in your life at that time

These are all functions of the Holy Spirit being your divine Teacher as you study His Word. 

When you pray and ask the Holy Spirit to open your eyes and understanding to study His Word ...
- come with a listening heart - be attentive to anything He may want to focus on, or point out
- have an attitude of expectation ...
    - expect His instruction, insight, undertanding, wisdom, discernment and knowledge
    - expect Him to answer your questions
        - He may answer directly, but if not ...
            - continue your study while also watching and expecting the answers as you progress
