*Father God,* 

*I dedicate this work to You.  You are the One Who not only instructed me to do it, but laid it upon my heart to lead Your people in such a way they, too, may come to know You and Your Word more intimately.*  

*You have done this for two reasons.  First, because You love Your people and want them to have a deep, intimate, personal relationship with them.  Secondly, because You love them, You desire they cultivate this relationship with You by way of Your Holy Spirit so they will not be deceived by any of the false christs, preachers, teachers, or apostles, who are pushing lies about You, and what Your Word **really** says.*

*I pray that Your people will come with willing and open hearts so that Your Spirit can plant Your Word in their hearts and that it might produce a hundred-fold harvest; all to Your glory, honor, praise and thanksgiving.  (Matthew 13:3-23).*

*I thank You for the privilege and opportunity to be Your vessel through which this project is created.  May Your Word not return to You empty without accomplishing everything for which You have sent it out to do.  (Isaiah 55:11).*
