## Why Bad Things Happen To Good People
___

This is a question that plagues many people.  The answer is somewhat complicated too, as there are several things one needs to keep in mind..

### I.  Satan
* Hates God and His People
* He Desires To Be Higher Than God, and Worshiped As God [Isaiah 14:12-13]
* God Threw Satan Out Of Heaven; Satan Took 1/3 Of The Angels With Him [Fallen Angels]
* Tried To Prevent The Birth Of Christ, God's Chosen Means Of Redeeming Mankind, By Corrupting Man's Gene Pool [Genesis 6 / Book of Enoch]
* Attempted To Destroy Mankind By Contaminating Our Genetic Makeup
    * Sons of God [Fallen Angels] Had Sex With Earthly Women, As Well As Animals [Genesis 6]
    * Their Offspring [aka Nephillim, 6-Toed Giants, Mighty Warriors] Were the Origin Of The Canabalistic Giants, and Genetic Hybrids
    * This Genetic Contamination Was The Reason For the Flood; As Well As God's Command For Israel To Destroy All The Canaanites, including the animals.  
    * Only Noah's Genetic DNA Was Untainted [Without Blemish - NLT says "blameless"]
    * God Preserved Noah In Order To Preserve The Divinely Created Genetic Makeup of Mankind From Whom Christ Was To Come According To Genesis 3
* Continually Attempted To Destroy Israel To Prevent The Birth Of Christ, God's Chosen Means Of Redeeming Mankind
* Continues To Attempt to Destroy Israel
    * They Are Still God's Chosen People, And In The End Times, Israel Will Be Saved
* Tries To Kill Christians
    * They Are The Body Of Christ
    * They Continue His Mission To Destroy The Works Of The Devil [1 John 3:8]
* Tries To Keep As Many As Possible From Becoming Christians [1 Peter 5:8]
* Entices People To Pervert Everything That Is Godly, Holy, and Clean Before God

### II.  The "World" / Unsaved Mankind
As A Result of Adam and Eve's Sin In The Garden ...
* Mankind has fallen under the curse and God's condemnation; we are "born" into it; it is our 'nature'. Romans 5:12-21]
    * We are full of every kind of wickedness, sin, greed, hate, envy, murder, quarreling, deception, malicious behavior, gossip; backstabbers, haters of God, insolent, proud boastful.  We invent new ways of sinning. [Rom 1:29-31] 

### III.  Our Own Sinful, Selfish Nature
* When we are controlled by our own nature, sinful desires are at work within us.  [Rom 7:5]
* Nothing good lives in us.  [Rom 7:18]
* The sinful nature is ALWAYS hostile to God.  It NEVER did obey His laws, and it never will. This is why those who are still under the control of their sinful nature can NEVER please God.  [Rom 8:7-8].

Remember - God has given us 'free will'.  People have a choice ... to follow their own will and desires; or to follow His Will and Desires.  Why?
* God wants a personal relationship with people; He wants to love them, and for them to love Him in return
* Otherwise, we'd all be automatons.  You can't have a 'relationship' with a robot.
* There are always consequences to peoples' choices.
* We suffer the consequences of other people's actions.
* We suffer the consequences of our own actions. 

BUT - with all that being said ... there is another side to this.

### I.  We are not to be surprised by these things.

> [!NOTE|iconVisibility:hidden]
> **1Pe 4:12-17 NLT** 
>
>12 Dear friends, don't be surprised at the fiery trials you are going through, as if something strange were happening to you.  
>
> 13 Instead, be very glad--for these trials make you partners with Christ in his suffering, so that you will have the wonderful joy of seeing his glory when it is revealed to all the world.  
> 
> 14 So be happy when you are insulted for being a Christian, for then the glorious Spirit of God rests upon you.  
> 
> 15 If you suffer, however, it must not be for murder, stealing, making trouble, or prying into other people's affairs.  
> 
> 16 But it is no shame to suffer for being a Christian. Praise God for the privilege of being called by his name!  
> 
> 17 For the time has come for judgment, and it must begin with God's household. And if judgment begins with us, what terrible fate awaits those who have never obeyed God's Good News? 

>[!NOTE|iconVisibility:hidden]
> **Jhn 15:18-21 NLT**  
>
> 18 "If the world hates you, remember that it hated me first.  
> 
> 19 The world would love you as one of its own if you belonged to it, but you are no longer part of the world. I chose you to come out of the world, so it hates you.  
> 
> 20 Do you remember what I told you? 'A slave is not greater than the master.' Since they persecuted me, naturally they will persecute you. And if they had listened to me, they would listen to you.  
> 
> 21 They will do all this to you because of me, for they have rejected the one who sent me.

### II.  Jesus told us the very members of our own households would be against us.

> [!NOTE|iconVisibility:hidden]
> **Mat 10:34-37 NLT**  
> 
> 34 "Don't imagine that I came to bring peace to the earth! I came not to bring peace, but a sword.  
> 
> 35 'I have come to set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.  
> 
> 36 Your enemies will be right in your own household!'  
> 
> 37 If you love your father or mother more than you love me, you are not worthy of being mine; or if you love your son or daughter more than me, you are not worthy of being mine.

### III.  God Chastens Those He Loves

> [!NOTE|iconVisibility:hidden]
> **Heb 12:5-11 NLT**  
>
> 5 And have you forgotten the encouraging words God spoke to you as his children? He said, "My child, don't make light of the LORD's discipline, and don't give up when he corrects you.  
> 
> 6 For the LORD disciplines those he loves, and he punishes each one he accepts as his child."  
> 
> 7 As you endure this divine discipline, remember that God is treating you as his own children. Who ever heard of a child who is never disciplined by its father?  
> 
> 8 If God doesn't discipline you as he does all of his children, it means that you are illegitimate and are not really his children at all.  
> 
> 9 Since we respected our earthly fathers who disciplined us, shouldn't we submit even more to the discipline of the Father of our spirits, and live forever?  
> 
> 10 For our earthly fathers disciplined us for a few years, doing the best they knew how. But God's discipline is always good for us, so that we might share in his holiness.  
> 
> 11 No discipline is enjoyable while it is happening--it's painful! But afterward there will be a peaceful harvest of right living for those who are trained in this way.

### IV.  We are even told to count it all joy!

> [!NOTE|iconVisibility:hidden]
> **Jas 1:2-4 NLT**  
> 
> 2 Dear brothers and sisters, when troubles come your way, consider it an opportunity for great joy. 
> 
> 3 For you know that when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow.  
> 
> 4 So let it grow, for when your endurance is fully developed, you will be perfect and complete, needing nothing.  

### V.  God Uses It to Refine / Purify Us

> [!NOTE|iconVisibility:hidden]
> **Rom 8:28 NLT**  
> 
> 28 And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them.

> [!NOTE|iconVisibility:hidden]
> **Isa 48:10 NLT**  
> 
> 10 I have refined you, but not as silver is refined. Rather, I have refined you in the furnace of suffering.

> [!NOTE|iconVisibility:hidden]
> **Dan 11:35 NLT**  
> 
> 35 And some of the wise will fall victim to persecution. In this way, they will be refined and cleansed and made pure until the time of the end, for the appointed time is still to come.

> [!NOTE|iconVisibility:hidden]
> **Dan 12:10 NLT**  
> 
> 10 Many will be purified, cleansed, and refined by these trials. But the wicked will continue in their wickedness, and none of them will understand. Only those who are wise will know what it means.

> [!NOTE|iconVisibility:hidden]
> **Zec 13:9 NLT**  
>
> 9 I will bring that group through the fire and make them pure. I will refine them like silver and purify them like gold. They will call on my name, and I will answer them. I will say, 'These are my people,' and they will say, 'The LORD is our God.'"
