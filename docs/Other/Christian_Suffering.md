	> 8 Three different times I begged the Lord to take [my thorn in the flesh] away.

	>  
	> 10 ***That's why I take pleasure in my weaknesses, and in the insults, harships, persecutions, and troubles that I suffer for Christ.  For when I am weak, then I am strong.***

	>  
	> 9 and become one with Him.  I no longer count on my own righteousness through obeying the law; rather, I become righteous through faith in Christ.  For God's way of making us right with Himself depends on faith.  
	>  
	> 10 ***I want to know Christ and experience the mighty power that raised Him from the dead.  I want to suffer with Him, sharing in His death,***

*	> [!NOTE|iconVisibility:hidden]  
	>  
	> **2 Timothy 1:11-12 NLT**  
	>  
	> 11 And God chose me to be a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of this Good News.  
	>  
	> 12 ***That is why I am suffering here in prison.***  But I am not ashamed of it, for I know the One in whom I trust, and I am sure that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him until the day of His return.

	>  
	> **2 Timothy 4:5-6 NLT**  
	>

	>  
	> 6 As for me, ***my life has already been poured out as an offering to God.***  The time of my death is near.

	>  
	> **1 Peter 4:12-16, 19 NLT**  
	>  
	> 12 Dear friends, don't be surprised at the fiery trials you are going through, as if something strange were happening to you.  
	>  
	> 13 ***Instead, be very glad -- for these trials make you partners with Christ in His suffering, so that you will hve the wonderful joy of seeing His glory when it is revealed to all the world.***  
	>  
	> 14 ***So be happy when you are insulted for being a Christian, for then the glorious SPirit of God rests upon you.***  
	>  
	> 15 If you suffer, however, it must not be for murder, stealing, making trouble, or prying into other people's affairs.  
	>  
	> 16 But it is no shame to suffer for being a Christian.  ***Praise God for the privilege of being called by His Name!***
