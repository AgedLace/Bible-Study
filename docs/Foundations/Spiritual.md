### Only Spiritual Men Can Receive From The Holy Spirit 
___
Scripture teaches us that God has made a covenant with us.  A small part of this covenant includes ...  

* **We will not need anyone to teach us**
* **The Holy Spirit will teach us everything we need to know**
* The Holy Spirit will remind us of everything Jesus told us
* We must receive the Holy Spirit
* The Holy Spirit lives inside us so we don't need anyone to teach us

> **Jer 31:33-34 NLT**
>
> 33 "But this is the new covenant I will make with the people of Israel on that day," says the LORD. "I will put my instructions deep within them, and I will write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. 
> 
> 34 And they will not need to teach their neighbors, nor will they need to teach their relatives, saying, 'You should know the LORD.' For everyone, from the least to the greatest, will know me already," says the LORD. "And I will forgive their wickedness, and I will never again remember their sins."

> 26 But when the Father sends the Advocate as my representative--that is, the Holy Spirit--he will teach you everything and will remind you of everything I have told you.

> **1Jo 2:27 NLT**   
> 
> 27 But you have received the Holy Spirit, and he lives within you, so you don't need anyone to teach you what is true. For the Spirit teaches you everything you need to know, and what he teaches is true--it is not a lie. So just as he has taught you, remain in fellowship with Christ.


The Hebrew word used for "covenant" is *beriyth* ...

> **Covenant - H1285 - beriyth**  
> 
> A covenant, so called from the idea of cutting, since it was the custom in making solemn covenants to pass between the divided parts of victims.  See Genesis 15:9.

The Bible tells us that God is spirit …  

> [!NOTE|style:callout]
> **Jhn 4:24 NLT**  
> 24 For God is Spirit, so those who worship him must worship in spirit and in truth."

God’s Word also tells us that understanding His Word cannot be done with our natural wisdom or understanding.

> [!NOTE|style:callout]
> **1Co 2:11-16 NLT**  
> 
> 11 No one can know a person's thoughts except that person's own spirit, and no one can know God's thoughts except God's own Spirit.  
> 
> 12 And we have received God's Spirit (not the world's spirit), so we can know the wonderful things God has freely given us.
>
> 13 When we tell you these things, we do not use words that come from human wisdom. Instead, we speak words given to us by the Spirit, using the Spirit's words to explain spiritual truths.
>
> 14 But people who aren't spiritual can't receive these truths from God's Spirit. It all sounds foolish to them and they can't understand it, for only those who are spiritual can understand what the Spirit means.
>
> 15 Those who are spiritual can evaluate all things, but they themselves cannot be evaluated by others.
>
> 16 For, "Who can know the LORD's thoughts? Who knows enough to teach him?"But we understand these things, for we have the mind of Christ.  

**This is important.** It is the reason why Jesus told His disciples to wait until they had received the Holy Spirit after He ascended into heaven to be seated at the Father’s right hand. Contrast their lives before receiving God’s Holy Spirit with what they were able to accomplish once they had received Him.

> 
> 4 Once when he was eating with them, he commanded them, "Do not leave Jerusalem until the Father sends you the gift he promised, as I told you before.  
> 
> 5 John baptized with water, but in just a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit."

5. Paul also tells us that his preaching was not done by human wisdom but rather by the words he received by God’s Spirit which were accompanied by the demonstration of the Spirit’s power.

> **1Co 2:1, 4-7, 9-16 NLT**  
> 
> 1 When I first came to you, dear brothers and sisters, I didn't use lofty words and impressive wisdom to tell you God's secret plan.
> 
> ...
> 
> 4 And my message and my preaching were very plain. Rather than using clever and persuasive speeches, I relied only on the power of the Holy Spirit.
>
> 5 I did this so you would trust not in human wisdom but in the power of God.
> 
> 6 Yet when I am among mature believers, I do speak with words of wisdom, but not the kind of wisdom that belongs to this world or to the rulers of this world, who are soon forgotten.
>
> 7 No, the wisdom we speak of is the mystery of God--his plan that was previously hidden, even though he made it for our ultimate glory before the world began.
> 
> ...
> 
> 9 That is what the Scriptures mean when they say, "No eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined what God has prepared for those who love him."
>
> 10 But it was to us that God revealed these things by his Spirit. For his Spirit searches out everything and shows us God's deep secrets.
> 
> 11 No one can know a person's thoughts except that person's own spirit, and no one can know God's thoughts except God's own Spirit.
> 
> 12 And we have received God's Spirit (not the world's spirit), so we can know the wonderful things God has freely given us.
> 
> 13 When we tell you these things, we do not use words that come from human wisdom. Instead, we speak words given to us by the Spirit, using the Spirit's words to explain spiritual truths.

All of that being said, the Bible also teaches us that ...

> [!NOTE|style:callout]
> **1Co 1:18-25 NLT**  
> 
> 18 The message of the cross is foolish to those who are headed for destruction! But we who are being saved know it is the very power of God.
> 
> 19 As the Scriptures say, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and discard the intelligence of the intelligent."
> 
> 20 So where does this leave the philosophers, the scholars, and the world's brilliant debaters? God has made the wisdom of this world look foolish.
> 
> 21 Since God in his wisdom saw to it that the world would never know him through human wisdom, he has used our foolish preaching to save those who believe.
> 
> 22 It is foolish to the Jews, who ask for signs from heaven. And it is foolish to the Greeks, who seek human wisdom.
> 
> 23 So when we preach that Christ was crucified, the Jews are offended and the Gentiles say it's all nonsense.
> 
> 24 But to those called by God to salvation, both Jews and Gentiles, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.
> 
> 25 This foolish plan of God is wiser than the wisest of human plans, and God's weakness is stronger than the greatest of human strength.

This is the reason I no longer engage in debates about what the Bible does or doesn’t say; the Bible calls this foolishness, godless, and a waste of time. Nothing has caused more division in the Body of Christ than people debating / arguing over what the Bible does or doesn’t say.

> **1Co 1:10 NLT**  
> I appeal to you, dear brothers and sisters, by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, to live in harmony with each other. Let there be no divisions in the church. Rather, be of one mind, united in thought and purpose.

> **1Ti 6:20-21 NLT**
>
> 20 Timothy, guard what God has entrusted to you. Avoid godless, foolish discussions with those who oppose you with their so-called knowledge.
> 
> 21 Some people have wandered from the faith by following such foolishness. May God's grace be with you all.

> [!NOTE|style:callout]
> **2Ti 2:16-17 NLT**
> 
> 16 Avoid worthless, foolish talk that only leads to more godless behavior.
> 
> 17 This kind of talk spreads like cancer, as in the case of Hymenaeus and Philetus.

> **2Ti 2:23-26 NLT**  
>
> 23 Again I say, don't get involved in foolish, ignorant arguments that only start fights.
> 
> 24 A servant of the Lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone, be able to teach, and be patient with difficult people.
> 25 Gently instruct those who oppose the truth. Perhaps God will change those people's hearts, and they will learn the truth.
> 
> 26 Then they will come to their senses and escape from the devil's trap. For they have been held captive by him to do whatever he wants.

In the next lesson, God wants me to cover the topic of salvation; specifically with respect to exactly what did Jesus mean when He said we “must be born again” and why this is important in light of the teaching in this lesson.
