### The Bible - God's Divine Revelation To Man

The whole premise of this work is to bring people to the place where they seek to get their understanding of the Bible from the very Person who wrote it in the first place ... the Holy Spirit of God.  

Paul tells us that God reveals things to us by and through His Holy Spirit.

> 10 But it was to us that God revealed these things by His Spirit.  For His Spirit searches out everything and shows us God's deep secrets.  

Paul also tells us that God, by and through His Holy Spirit, inspired, or breathed, His divine revelation into men so that we might be:  

* taught what is true
* corrected and convicted of what is wrong in our lives
* teaches us to do what is right
* prepares and equips us to do every good work

> **2 Timothy 3:16-17 NLT**  
> 
> 16 **ALL** Scripture is **inspired by God** and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives.  It corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right.  
> 
> 17 God uses it to prepare and equip His people to do every good work.  

Other translations, such as the Berean Study Bible, translates the word for "inspired" above as "God-breathed".

The Bible tells us that God's Word is perfect.

Jesus told us that the Scriptures cannot be  altered or broken.

> 
> 35 And you know that **the Scriptures cannot be altered**.  So if those people who received God's message were called 'gods,'

> 35 If He called them gods to whom the Word of God came -- and **the Scripture cannot be broken** --
