## Foundational Truths

### Purpose Of This Project

With the exception of laying the foundational groundwork in this section, God has instructed me not to teach His Word, or lead Bible studies in the more traditional sense. Rather, He has instructed me to teach you, by example, how to receive your instruction and understanding of His Word directly from Him.

The reason for this is two-fold.  

* First, God wants to have a personal relationship with you.
    *  He provided Jesus Christ as the means by which we have such a relationship. [See 'Salvation'](/Foundations/005-Salvation)
* Second, there is a great deal of misunderstanding, misinformation and even deception taught about the Scriptures, both in and outside, the church.
    *  Jesus warned us about this many times ...

        > 25 See, I have warned you about this ahead of time.

    * Paul also warned us ...

        > **Acts 20:29 NLT**
        >
        > 29 I know that false teachers, like vicious wolves, will come in among you after I leave, not sparing the flock.

        > **2 Corinthians 11:13 NLT**
        > 
        > 13 These people are false apostles.  They are deceitful workers who disguise themselves as apostles of Christ.

    * There are many other such warnings in the Scriptures.  Fortunately, God has provided us the means to identify these false christs, prophets, teachers, apostles, etc.  

        *   The Scriptures are God-breathed (meaning inspired by His Spirit)
            > [!NOTE|iconVisibility:hidden]
            > **2 Timothy 3:16-17 NLT**
            > 
            > 16 **All** Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives.  It corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right.

            > 17 God uses it to prepare and equip His people to do every good work.
        * God sent us this very same Holy Spirit to teach us Himself

            > **John 14:26 NLT**
            > 
            > 26 But when the Father sends the Advocate as My representative -- that is, the Holy Spirit -- He will teach youe verything and will remind you of everything I have told you.

        > [!NOTE|iconVisibility:hidden]
        > **1 John 2:27 NLT**
        > 
        > 27 But you have received the Holy Spirit, and He lives within you, so you don't need anyone to teach you what is true.  For the Spirit teaches you everything you need to know, and what He teaches is true -- it is not a lie.  So just as He has taught you, remain in fellowship with Christ.
