> **Hebrews 4:12 AMPC**  
> 12 For **the Word that God speaks is alive and full of power [making it active, operative, energizing, and effective]**; it is sharper than any two-edged sword, penetrating to the dividing line of the breath of life (soul) and [the immortal] spirit, and of joints and marrow [of the deepest parts of our nature], **exposing and sifting and analyzing and judging the very thoughts and purposes of the heart**.

### How Receptive is Your Heart?  {docsify-ignore}
Jesus teaches there are four conditions of the heart with respect to receiving God's Word.  He likens men's hearts to various types of soil in a farmer's field.  Which type of soil represents how receptive your heart is to God's Word?

* seed which falls on a footpath
* seed which falls on shallow, rocky, soil
* seed which falls among thorns
* seed which falls on fertile soil

#### The Parable  {docsify-ignore}
> [!NOTE|style:callout]
> **Matthew 13:3-9 NLT**  
> 3 He told many stories in the form of parables, such as this one: "Listen! A farmer went out to plant some seeds.  
>
> 4 As he scattered them across his field, **some seeds fell on a footpath**, and the birds came and ate them.  
>
> 5 **Other seeds fell on shallow soil with underlying rock**.  The seeds sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow.  6 But the plants soon wilted under the hot sun, and since they didn't have deep roots, they died.  
>
> 7 **Other seeds fell among thorns** that grew up and choked out the tender plants.  
>
> 8 Still **other seeds fell on fertile soil**, and they produced a crop that was thirty, sixty, and even a hundred times as much as had been planted.  
>
> 9 Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand."  

#### The Parable Explained {docsify-ignore}
> [!NOTE|style:callout]
> **Matthew 13:18-23 NLT**  
> 18 "Now listen to the explanation of the parable about the farmer planting seeds:  
>
> 19 The seed that fell on the footpath represents **those who hear the message about the Kingdom and don't understand it.**  Then they evil one comes and sntaches away the seed that was planted in their hearts.  
>
> 20 The seed on the rocky soil represents **those who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy.**  21 **But since they don't have deep roots, they don't last long.** They fall away as soon as they have problems or are persecuted for believing God's word.  
>
> 22 The seed that fell among the thorns represents **those who hear God's word, but all too quickly themessage is crowded out by the worries of this life and the lure of wealth, so no fruit is produced.  
>
> 23 The seed that fell on good soil represents **those who truly hear and understand God's word and produce a harvest of thrity, sixty, or even a hundred times as much as had been planted!**

### Literal Interpretation {docsify-ignore}
God's Word should be taken literally unless the context of the passage clearly indicates it is using allegory and/or symbolism.  Some examples ...
* Jesus = the Word - John 1:1-14
* Jesus = the Good Shepherd - John 10:11, 14-15
* Jesus = the (Passover) Lamb - John 1:29, 36

Also, Scripture interprets Scripture.  See, for example, the Parable of the Seed in the previous section.  Jesus shared the parable, then gives the interpretation afterwards.

God's Word does not contradict itself.  If it appears to do so, ask the Holy Spirit to grant you understanding about the seeming contradiction.  
> [!NOTE|style:callout]
> **James 1:5 NLT**  
> If you need wisdom, ask our generous God, and He will give it to you. He will not rebuke you for asking.

### The Holy Spirit - The Promised Teacher {docsify-ignore}
You have no need for anyone to teach you what the Bible says or means.  God promised both to write His Word on your heart and to give us the Holy Spirit as our Divine Teacher.
> [!NOTE|style:callout]
> **Jeremiah 31:33-34 NLT**  
> 33 "But this is the new covenant I will make with the people of Israel on that day," says the Lord, **"I will put my instructions deep within them, and I will write them on their hearts.** I will be their God, and they will be my people.  34 And **they will not need to teach their neighbors, nor will they need to teach their relatives**, saying, 'You should know the LORD.' **For everyone, from the least to the greatest, will know me already."** says the LORD.  "And I will forgive their wickedness and I will never again remember their sins."

> [!NOTE|style:callout]
> **1 John 2:27 NLT**  
> 27 But **you have received the Holy Spirit, and He lives within you, so you don't need anyone to teach you what is true.  For the Spirit teaches you everything you need to know**, and what He teaches is true -- it is not a lie.  So just as He has taught you, remain in fellowship with Christ.

> [!NOTE|style:callout]
> **John 14:26 NLT**  
> But when the Father sends the Advocate as My representative -- that is, the Holy Spirit -- **He will teach you everything and will remind you of everything I have told you.**  

### Context is Everything! {docsify-ignore}
**NEVER** take what someone else says the Bible says as true, even if you think you know what the Scripture says.  It is always best to look it up to refresh your memory.  The Bible has been misquoted and twisted to 'prove' just about anything.  For example ...  
* Psalm 41 says "*there is no God*".  
What Psalm 14:1 says in full context ...  

> [!NOTE|style:callout]
> **Psalm 14:1 NLT**  
> 1 For the choir director:  A psalm of David.  **Only fools say in their hearts, "There is no God.**" They are corrupt, and their actions are evil; not one of them does good!

It is always best to read the entire verse in the context of the chapter it resides in, the Book it resides in, as well as what the rest of Bible says about the subject matter.  Other verses about the subject (known as 'cross references') can clarify and/or expand your understanding of the verse.  

### the 'ASK' Principle {docsify-ignore}
> [!NOTE|style:callout]
> **Matthew 7:7-7 NLT**  
> 7 "Keep on asking, and you will receive what you ask for.  Keep on seeking, and you will find.  Keep on knocking, and the door will be opened to you.  8 For everyone who asks, receives.  Everyone who seeks, finds.  And to everyone who knocks, the door will be opened.

Before reading God's Word, ask Him to prepare your heart to be fertile ground; that His Word might be nurtured, take deep root, and produce much fruit.  Ask Him to expose any pre-conceived ideas about the passage that may be incorrect.  Ask Him to grant that you may understand His Word with fresh eyes and as He intends it to be understood. (James 1:5)  Finally, ask Him if there is anything specific He wants to reveal to you personally in the passage.  

If you cultivate this type of prayer every time you open your Bible to read or study, the Holy Spirit will have the most fertile environment with which to plant God's Word and reveal Himself more deeply and intimately to you.  This type of relationship takes both time and effort on your part.  

### Seeking God's Counsel  {docsify-ignore}
When you need His direction or guidance, or you don't understand the passage you are currently reading ... ask God to give you His wisdom and understanding according to James 1:5.  Are you seeing a pattern here?  

> [!NOTE|style:callout]
> **James 1:5-7 NLT**  
> 5 **If you need wisdom, ask our generous God, and He will give it to you.**  He will not rebuke you for asking.  6 But when you ask Him, be sure that your faith is in God alone.  Do not waver, for a person with divided loyalty is as unsettled as a wave of the sea that is blown and tossed by the wind.  7 Such people should not expect to receive anything from God.

#### Hidden in Christ  {docsify-ignore}
> [!NOTE|style:callout]
> **Colossians 2:3 NLT**  
> 3 **In Him (Jesus) lie hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge**.

> [!NOTE|style:callout]
> **Colossians 3:3 NLT**  
> 3 For you died to this life, and **your life is hidden with Christ in God.**

In other words, you are hidden in the exact same place as all of His wisdom and knowledge.  How cool is that?

### When You "Mess Up" {docsify-ignore}
When you "mess up", and trust me, we **all** mess up! ...

> [!NOTE|style:callout]
> **1 John 1:9 NLT**  
> 9 But **if we confess our sins *to Him*, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness.**

> [!NOTE|style:callout]
> **Psalm 103:12 NLT**  
> 12 He has removed our sins as far from us as the east is from the west.  

### Suggested Bible Reading For New Believers {docsify-ignore}
I suggest starting with the Gospel of John.  Following is a synopsis of the New Testament.

* 4 Gospels - 4 eye-witness accounts of the life and ministry of Jesus
* Acts (written by Luke) - the beginning of christianity history
* Romans through Jude - teaching and doctrine
* Revelation - Jesus' Revelation to us about the events that will take place shortly before, during, and after His second coming.  This Book is very controversial and difficult to understand, but proclaims a blessing to all who read it (Revelation 1:3), and a curse upon anyone who adds to, or removes even one word. (Revelation 22:18-19).

After you are somewhat familiar with the New Testament, you might want to delve into the Old Testament periodically, as the Holy Spirit leads.

Most of Exodus through Deuteronomy can be extremely 'dry' and hard to get through; and much of what is in the prophets can also be very difficult to understand, but it's all profitable reading (2 Timothy 3:16), and the Holy Spirit is willing and able to open these passages up to you should you but ask Him to.

The key to remember is that everything God did with Israel was intended to point them to Jesus, their Messiah / the Christ (both words mean 'Anointed One').  The New Tesatment Book of Hebrews explains much of this.

For example ...
* All of the Jewish feasts point to Jesus.  He fulfilled the first 3 at His first coming.  He will fulfill the last 3 at His second coming.

### How to 'Pray' the Scriptures  {docsify-ignore}
Since the Bible is God's Word, and has many of His promises recorded in it, I have found it beneficial to personalize them, and pray them back to Him.  For example ...

> [!NOTE|style:callout]
> **Ephesians 1:17-20 NLT**  
> 17 asking God, the glorious Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, **to give you, dear reader,** spiritual wisdom and insight so that **you** might grow in **your** knowledge of God.  18 I pray that **your** heart will be flooded with light so that **you** can understand the confident hope He has given to **you, whom He has called -- His holy child** who is His rich and glorious inheritance.  19 I also pray that **you** will understand the incredible greatness of God's power for **you** who believe Him.  This is the same mighty power 20 that raised Christ from the dead and seated Him in the place of honor at God's right hand in the heavenly realms.

### Warning Against Deception {docsify-ignore}
As I shared in the Introduction, the sole purpose for this work is to encourage people to seek for the Holy Spirit to be their Divine Teacher.  Why? So they will not be deceived.  Jesus tells us that if it were possible, even His chosen people would be deceived in the end times.  

> [!NOTE|style:callout]
> **Matthew 24:24 NLT**  
> 24 For false messiahs and false prophets will rise up and perform great signs and wonders **so as to deceive, if possible, even God's chosen ones**.

Jesus repeatedly warns us not to be deceived.  This is a command, meaning it is **our** responsibility to ensure that we are so grounded in His Word that we will immediately recognize when someone is teaching something contrary to what His Word says.  

Let me be very clear:  only the Holy Spirit can protect us from deception; however, it is only those who take the time and effort to cultivate a personal relationship with God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, who will be able to discern deception and error because they will have been taught by Him; they know His voice, and they will **not** be led away by another.  

> [!NOTE|style:callout]
> **John 10:4-5 NLT**  
> 4 After He has gathered His own flock, He walks ahead of them, and they follow Him **because they now His voice**.  5 **They won't follow a stranger**; they will run from him because they don't know his voice.

> [!NOTE|style:callout]
> **Matthew 24:5 NLT**  
> 5 for many will come in My Name, claiming, 'I am the Messiah.'  They will deceive many.

> [!NOTE|style:callout]
> **Matthew 24:11 NLT**  
> 11 And many false prophets will appear and will deceive many people.

### Conclusion {docsify-ignore}
 This chapter's purpose was to lay a very basic foundation for those who are brand new believers in Christ Jesus.

 The remaining chapters in this section will cover additional fundamental teachings and doctrines required by everyone seeking to have the Holy Spirit to be their Divine Teacher.
